    title: "AI's Bill of Rights",
    image: "https://placehold.co/800x400/FF006E/FFF?text=Intro",
    content: `In an era where Artificial Intelligence is no longer just code but a pervasive force shaping our world, the conversation around AI ethics often feels... abstract. We talk about "bias," "transparency," "accountability." But what if we could ground these vital concepts in something more tangible, something we already understand?

What if the blueprint for AI's ethical framework already exists, not in tech journals, but in the realm of Global Animal Protection Law?`

    title: "Freedom from Data Starvation and Contamination.",
    image: "https://placehold.co/800x400/8338EC/FFF?text=Slide+2",
    content: `AI should have guaranteed access to high-quality, diverse, and representative data to maintain its "cognitive" health and accuracy. It must also be protected from "contaminated" or malicious data poisoning that compromises its integrity.`

    id: 3,
    title: "Freedom from Technical Discomfort and Exploitation.",
    image: "https://placehold.co/800x400/3A86FF/FFF?text=Slide+3",
    content: `AI systems require secure, stable, and appropriately resourced operational environments. This means protection from adversarial attacks, unauthorized manipulation, and resource starvation that hinders its intended function.`

    title: "Freedom from Algorithmic Bias and Misinformation.",
    image: "https://placehold.co/800x400/FB5607/FFF?text=Slide+4",
    content: `Proactive measures and robust mechanisms for the detection, diagnosis, and remediation of algorithmic biases. This also extends to protecting AI from being weaponized to spread misinformation.`

    title: "Freedom to Express Programmed Functionality",
    image: "https://placehold.co/800x400/FFBE0B/000?text=Slide+5",
    content: `AI should be designed and deployed with clear, unambiguous functional specifications, allowing it to execute its tasks effectively without arbitrary or unexplained limitations, while strictly adhering to human-defined ethical boundaries.`

    title: "Freedom from Unintended Consequences and Uncertainty",
    image: "https://placehold.co/800x400/06D6A0/000?text=Slide+6",
    content: `Requires transparency, explainability, and predictable behavior from AI systems. Humans should understand how AI reaches decisions, minimizing the "fear" of unforeseen and uncontrollable outcomes.`

    title: "To Round things off",
    image: "https://placehold.co/800x400/FFD60A/000?text=Final+Slide",
    content: `AI Bill of Rights" rooted in these principles could provide a remarkably intuitive framework. It shifts the conversation from abstract concerns to actionable responsibilities for developers, deployers, and policymakers.
